# Cursed-Gold
Small game I created

This is my first foray into GitHub, so I decided that I would upload a simple game that I had to make for an asssignent I had in my computer science class.

The point of the game is to avoid being the last player to take 1,2, or 3 coins from a coin pile that starts off at 16 coins.
